UNDERSTANDING FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE NASAL SPRAY What Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray is, and how it works. What is Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray? Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray is an effective, allergy medicine that you can now buy without a prescription. It works directly in the nose to help block your allergic reactions. Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray relieves allergy symptoms caused by pollen, mold, dust and pets. What is the active ingredient in Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray? The active ingredient in Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray is called fluticasone propionate. Fluticasone propionate is a glucocorticoid \u2013 a substance produced naturally by your body to help fight inflammation. It works in your nose to relieve your allergy symptoms. Barely any of it travels through your body. It\u2019s been prescribed by doctors for over 20 years, and used effectively by millions. A glucocorticoid is a kind of steroid that is different from the anabolic (muscle-building) steroids sometimes misused by athletes.

For complete guidance, check the Drug Facts label on the back of the Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray package. Can I use Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray for asthma?

No, use Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray to treat only your allergies \u2013 not your cold symptoms. If you\u2019re not sure whether your symptoms come from allergies or a cold, ask your doctor. What happens when you have allergies? Allergies start when allergens like pollen or pet dander enter your body and trigger your immune system to respond.

Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray acts on multiple inflammatory substances, including histamine, prostaglandins, cytokines, tryptases, chemokines and leukotrienes. Most common OTC allergy pills act on histamine alone. Because of the way it works, it may take several days for Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray to reach maximum effect. That\u2019s why it\u2019s best to use Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray regularly, once a day.

UNDERSTANDING FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE NASAL SPRAY What Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray is, and how it works. What is Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray? Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray is an effective, allergy medicine that you can buy without a prescription. It works directly in the nose to help block your allergic reactions. Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray relieves allergy symptoms caused by pollen, mold, dust and pets. What is the active ingredient in Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray? The active ingredient in Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray is called fluticasone propionate. Fluticasone propionate is a glucocorticoid \u2013 a substance produced naturally by your body to help fight inflammation. It works in your nose to relieve your allergy symptoms. Barely any of it travels through your body. It\u2019s been prescribed by doctors for over 20 years, and used effectively by millions. A glucocorticoid is a kind of steroid that is different from the anabolic (muscle-building) steroids sometimes misused by athletes. In fact, world class athletes are allowed to use glucocorticoids during competition to treat their allergies. Who should not use Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray? For complete guidance, check the Drug Facts label on the back of the Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray package. Can I use Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray for asthma? No, Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray is not a treatment for asthma. Ask your doctor what medicine to take for your asthma. Can I use Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray for colds? No, use Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray to treat only your allergies \u2013 not your cold symptoms. If you\u2019re not sure whether your symptoms come from allergies or a cold, ask your doctor. What happens when you have allergies? Allergies start when allergens like pollen or pet dander enter your body and trigger your immune system to respond. Your body\u2019s natural response is to release multiple inflammatory substances, (also referred to as mediators) that cause your allergy symptoms. How does Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray work? Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray works right in your nose to help block your allergic reaction at the source to relieve the symptoms that make you uncomfortable. Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray acts on multiple inflammatory substances, including histamine, prostaglandins, cytokines, tryptases, chemokines and leukotrienes. Most common OTC allergy pills act on histamine alone. Because of the way it works, it may take several days for Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray to reach maximum effect. That\u2019s why it\u2019s best to use Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray regularly, once a day. Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray not only relieves sneezing, itchy nose, runny nose and itchy, watery eyes, but also relieves nasal congestion.

UNDERSTANDING FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE NASAL SPRAY What Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray is, and how it works. What is Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray? Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray is an effective, allergy medicine that you can buy without a prescription. It works directly in the nose to help block your allergic reactions. Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray relieves allergy symptoms caused by pollen, mold, dust and pets. What is the active ingredient in Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray? The active ingredient in Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray is called fluticasone propionate. Fluticasone propionate is a glucocorticoid \u2013 a substance produced naturally by your body to help fight inflammation. It works in your nose to relieve your allergy symptoms. Barely any of it travels through your body. It\u2019s been prescribed by doctors for over 20 years, and used effectively by millions. A glucocorticoid is a kind of steroid that is different from the anabolic (muscle-building) steroids sometimes misused by athletes. In fact, world class athletes are allowed to use glucocorticoids during competition to treat their allergies. Who should not use Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray? For complete guidance, check the Drug Facts label on the back of the Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray package. Can I use Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray for asthma? No, Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray is not a treatment for asthma. Ask your doctor what medicine to take for your asthma. Can I use Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray for colds? No, use Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray to treat only your allergies \u2013 not your cold symptoms. If you\u2019re not sure whether your symptoms come from allergies or a cold, ask your doctor. What happens when you have allergies? Allergies start when allergens like pollen or pet dander enter your body and trigger your immune system to respond. Your body\u2019s natural response is to release multiple inflammatory substances, (also referred to as mediators) that cause your allergy symptoms. How does Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray work? Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray works right in your nose to help block your allergic reaction at the source to relieve the symptoms that make you uncomfortable. Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray acts on multiple inflammatory substances, including histamine, prostaglandins, cytokines, tryptases, chemokines and leukotrienes. Most common OTC allergy pills act on histamine alone. Because of the way it works, it may take several days for Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray to reach maximum effect. That\u2019s why it\u2019s best to use Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray regularly, once a day. Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray not only relieves sneezing, itchy nose, runny nose and itchy, watery eyes, but also relieves nasal congestion.
