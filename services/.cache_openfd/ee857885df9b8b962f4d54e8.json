You only need to use ITSRT every 3 to 4 days (about twice a week) for 8 weeks. On the days you don\u2019t use ITSRT, you can use your regular shampoo and conditioner. Can I continue to use ITSRT? Always follow the label instructions. You may use ITSRT every 3 to 4 days (about twice a week) for 8 weeks, then as needed to control dandruff. Is ITSRT safe to use on color-treated or keratin-treated hair? Yes, ITSRT is safe to use on color-treated, chemically processed, and gray hair. Is it okay to use a conditioner with ITSRT? We recommend using a conditioner between uses of ITSRT. Some dandruff shampoos don\u2019t smell very good; how does ITSRT smell? ITSRT has a clean, fresh scent and a pearlescent, soft look and feel. Does ITSRT work on severe dandruff? Clinical studies show that ITSRT is effective in controlling symptoms of mild, moderate, and even severe dandruff, such as flaking, dryness, and itching. How fast does ITSRT work? Always follow the label instructions and use ITSRT every 3 to 4 days (about twice a week) for 8 weeks. Published clinical study results show that ketoconazole, the active ingredient in ITSRT, starts working from the first use to relieve dandruff symptoms and control the fungus that causes dandruff."], "package_label_principal_display_panel": ["PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL 141"], "set_id": "25b046bb-6ee4-bebc-e063-6394a90aec6a", "id": "25b04737-7355-d8b7-e063-6394a90ab23f", "effective_time": "20241030", "version": "95", "openfda": {"application_number": ["M016"], "brand_name": ["ITSRT Tea Tree Oil and Argan Oil"], "generic_name": ["ITSRT TEA TREE OIL AND ARGAN OIL"], "manufacturer_name": ["Guangzhou Qiaoyangzi Cosmetics Technology Co Ltd"], "product_ndc": ["84751-095"], "product_type": ["HUMAN OTC DRUG"], "route": ["TOPICAL"], "substance_name": ["ALOE VERA LEAF", "BIOTIN", "CAFFEINE", "FALLOPIA MULTIFLORA ROOT", "GLYCERIN", "GREEN TEA LEAF", "PANTHENOL", "ROSEMARY", "SALICYLIC ACID", "SELENIUM SULFIDE"], "spl_id": ["25b04737-7355-d8b7-e063-6394a90ab23f"], "spl_set_id": ["25b046bb-6ee4-bebc-e063-6394a90aec6a"], "package_ndc": ["84751-095-01"], "is_original_packager": [true], "upc": ["6974850160990"], "nui": ["N0000175739", "N0000175729", "N0000175790", "M0023046", "N0000185370", "N0000175629", "N0000184306", "N0000185001", "M0000728", "M0009417"], "pharm_class_epc": ["Central Nervous System Stimulant [EPC]", "Methylxanthine [EPC]", "Non-Standardized Chemical Allergen [EPC]"], "pharm_class_pe": ["Central Nervous System Stimulation [PE]", "Increased Histamine Release [PE]", "Cell-mediated Immunity [PE]", "Increased IgG Production [PE]"], "pharm_class_cs": ["Xanthines [CS]", "Allergens [CS]", "Glycerol [CS]"], "unii": ["ZY81Z83H0X", "6SO6U10H04", "3G6A5W338E", "AUZ3VD75MC", "PDC6A3C0OX", "W2ZU1RY8B0", "WV9CM0O67Z", "IJ67X351P9", "O414PZ4LPZ", "Z69D9E381Q"]}}, {"spl_product_data_elements": ["ExoSCRT Scalp Care HRLV Biotin TREHALOSE MANNITOL BIOTIN BIOTIN"], "active_ingredient": ["ACTIVE INGREDIENT Biotin 0.05%"], "inactive_ingredient": ["INACTIVE INGREDIENTS Rosa Damascena Callus Extracellular Vesicles, Trehalose, Mannitol, Methionine, Glutamine, Sodium Bicarbonate, Potassium Chloride, Alanine, Arginine, Lysine HCL, Tryptophan, Tyrosine, Valine, Histidine, Aspartic Acid, Glutamic Acid, Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide, Disodium Flavine Adenine Dinucleotide, Thiamine Diphosphate, Coenzyme A, sh-Oligopeptide-1, sh-Oligopeptide-4, sh-Polypeptide-4, sh-Polypeptide-9, sh-Polypeptide-13, sh-Polypeptide-8, sh-Polypeptide-1, sh-Polypeptide-3, sh-Oligopeptide-2, sh-Polypeptide-11, Copper Tripeptide-1, Leucine, Isoleucine, Phenylalanine, Glycine, Serine, Ornithine HCL, Threonine, Magnesium Sulfate, Proline, Ascorbic Acid"], "purpose": ["PURPOSE Scalp Care"], "warnings": ["WARNINGS For external use only, not to be swallowed.
