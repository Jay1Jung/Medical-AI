Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis. It mainly affects a type of tissue called cartilage, which cushions the joints and prevents the bones from rubbing against each other.

What is Diclofenac Sodium Topical Gel, 1% used for? Diclofenac Sodium Topical Gel, 1% can be used for the temporary relief of arthritis pain in the hands, wrists, elbows, feet, ankles, and knees. Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis. It mainly affects a type of tissue called cartilage, which cushions the joints and prevents the bones from rubbing against each other. With OA, cartilage begins to break down and wear away, resulting in joint pain and stiffness. OA occurs more frequently as you get older. Pain develops slowly and can gradually worsen over time. How does Diclofenac Sodium Topical Gel, 1% work? Diclofenac sodium, the medicine in Diclofenac Sodium Topical Gel, 1%, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). NSAIDs are used to treat pain from medical conditions such as arthritis.

However, when taking a pill, the medication is distributed to the site of pain through the bloodstream. Compared to oral diclofenac, only 6% of the medicine in Diclofenac Sodium Topical Gel, 1% is absorbed in the bloodstream.
