This product contains a 1-dose vaginal insert that cures most vaginal yeast infections, plus an external cream that can be used for relief of itching and irritation on the skin outside the vagina (vulva) due to a yeast infection. Do not use this product if this is the first time you have vaginal discharge, itching, burning and discomfort. See your doctor or health professional first to find out the cause of your symptoms. If a doctor has told you in the past that you had a vaginal yeast infection and you have the same symptoms now (such as vaginal discharge, itching or burning), then this product may work for you. What is a vaginal yeast infection? A vaginal yeast infection is a common condition caused by an overgrowth of yeast (Candida) that may normally live in the vagina. Your doctor may call this infection \u201cmonilia\u201d or \u201ccandidiasis.\u201d Some women may have a yeast infection on the skin outside of the vagina (vulva) at the same time that they have a vaginal infection. Who can get a vaginal yeast infection? You can get a vaginal yeast infection at any age. It is most common during the childbearing years. Women who are pregnant or diabetic, taking antibiotics, birth control pills or steroids, or who have a weakened immune system are more likely to get repeated yeast infections that may not clear up easily with proper treatment. Some medical conditions can weaken the body's normal ability to fight infection. One of the most serious of these conditions is infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV - the virus that causes AIDS). The HIV virus causes the body to be more likely to get infections, including vaginal yeast infections that may not clear up easily with proper treatment. If you may have been exposed to HIV and get repeated vaginal yeast infections, you should see your doctor right away. For more information on HIV infection, please contact your doctor or the CDC National AIDS HOTLINE. The CDC phone numbers are: 1-800-232-4636 (English/Spanish), or 1-888-232-6348 (hearing impaired, TTY). How can I tell if I have a vaginal yeast infection? When you have a vaginal yeast infection, you may have one or more of the following symptoms: \u2022 vaginal itching \u2022 vaginal discharge that may be thick, white, and lumpy like cottage cheese \u2022 vaginal soreness, irritation, or burning \u2022 rash or redness on the skin outside the vagina (vulva) \u2022 burning on urination \u2022 painful vaginal intercourse (sex) Note: Vaginal yeast infections do NOT cause fever, chills, lower abdominal, back or shoulder pain, foul-smelling vaginal discharge, or a missed period. These may be signs of a sexually transmitted disease (STD) or a tubal pregnancy. If you have these symptoms, call your doctor right away. What are other causes of a vaginal discharge? It is normal to have a small amount of vaginal discharge at certain times of the month. This normal discharge may be clear or slightly white and does not cause itching, pain or a foul odor. The most common cause of an abnormal vaginal discharge is an infection. These infections include bacterial vaginosis (BV), trichomoniasis (Trich), gonorrhea (GC) and/or chlamydia. All of these may be transmitted sexually and are called sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). If you have more questions about sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) call the CDC STD Hotline at 1-800-227-8922. Although many of the infections mentioned above can cause symptoms similar to a vaginal yeast infection (vaginal discharge, irritation and itching), their diagnosis must be made by a doctor so that proper treatment can be given. If these infections are not properly treated or if proper treatment is delayed, serious problems, such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) may result, which may prevent you from having children in the future. If you are pregnant and do not get the proper treatment, the infection may be passed to your baby before or during delivery and may cause your baby to have permanent damage. If you have multiple sex partners or a new sex partner, you should also ask a doctor before use to make sure you do not have an STD. Why do women get repeated vaginal yeast infections? Women may get repeated vaginal yeast infections that may not clear up easily with proper treatment. Listed below are some of the causes of repeated yeast infections: \u2022 hormonal changes occurring a few days before the monthly period \u2022 use of antibiotics \u2022 use of some birth control pills \u2022 pregnancy \u2022 diabetes (\u201csugar\u201d or \u201chigh blood sugar\u201d) \u2022 clothing \u2013 wearing tight layers or moist clothing in the genital area \u2022 weakened immune system \u2013 some drugs (such as chemotherapy or steroids) and medical conditions can weaken the body\u2019s normal ability to fight infection. One of the most serious of these conditions is the infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV \u2013 the virus that causes AIDS). Infection with HIV causes the person to be more likely to get infections, including vaginal yeast infections. If you get vaginal yeast infections often (such as once a month or 3 in 6 months), you should talk to a doctor. Are vaginal yeast infections sexually transmitted? Vaginal yeast infections are usually not spread by having intercourse (sex). However, if your partner has a rash, itching or discomfort in his genital area, he should contact a doctor to find out the cause of his symptoms and tell the doctor that you are treating your vaginal yeast infection with this product. How can I prevent repeated vaginal yeast infections? To lower your chances of getting another yeast infection: \u2022 Try to keep the genital area cool and dry. Yeast grow well in warm, moist area. The following suggestions may be helpful: (1) Wear cotton underwear and loose-fitting clothes. (2) Change out of damp clothes or a wet bathing suit as soon as possible. (3) If you use minipads when you are not having a menstrual period, change the minipads often. \u2022 Talk with your doctor about any drugs you are now taking. You are more likely to get a vaginal yeast infection if you are taking certain drugs such as antibiotics, steroids, or birth control pills. Do not stop taking these drugs without first asking your doctor. A doctor may need to see you to make sure that you do not have other medical conditions such as diabetes or a weakened immune system. Can I use this product during my menstrual period? Yes, this product can be used during your menstrual period. In fact, many women get vaginal yeast infections just before their period because of hormonal changes. Using this product during your period will not affect how well this product works. If you have started treatment and your period occurs, you should complete the full course of treatment. Do not use tampons while using this product, because tampons may remove some of the drug from the vagina. Use deodorant-free sanitary napkins or pads instead, and change them often. Can I use other vaginal products with this product? This drug should not be used with other vaginal products. \u2022 Douches and tampons may remove some of the vaginal insert from the vagina. \u2022 Spermicides may interfere with this product. \u2022 Condoms and diaphragms may be damaged by this product and fail to prevent pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). How can I get the best results when treating my infection? \u2022 Use the vaginal insert, even during your menstrual period. \u2022 Use the tube of cream externally only while symptoms are present. If you have symptoms (such as itching and irritation) on the skin outside the vagina (vulva), apply the cream externally 2 times a day, up to a total of 7 days, as needed. \u2022 Dry the genital area thoroughly after a shower, bath or swim. Change out of a wet bathing suit or damp clothes as soon as possible. A dry area is less likely to lead to the overgrowth of yeast. \u2022 Wear cotton underwear and loose-fitting clothes. \u2022 Wipe from front to back after a bowel movement or after urination. \u2022 Do not douche, because douching may wash the drug out of the vagina. \u2022 Do not use tampons, because they remove some of the drug from the vagina. Use deodorant-free sanitary napkins or pads as needed. \u2022 Do not use spermicides, as they may interfere with this product. \u2022 Do not have vaginal intercourse while using this product. \u2022 Do not scratch the skin outside the vagina. Scratching can cause more irritation and can spread the infection. \u2022 Tell your doctor about any drugs you are now taking. Certain drugs such as antibiotics, steroids, and birth control pills, may make it more likely for you to get a vaginal yeast infection. If you are taking any of these drugs do not stop taking them without first asking a doctor. \u2022 If you have any other medical questions or concerns about vaginal yeast infections, call your doctor. What warnings should I know about when using this product? For vaginal use only. Do not use if you have never had a vaginal yeast infection diagnosed by a doctor.
