DISTRIBUTED BY THE KROGER CO., CINCINNATI, OHIO 45202 MADE IN INDIA \u2021OUR PHARMACIST RECOMMENDED Code: TS/DRUGS/58039/2020 Thank you for purchasing Docosanol Cream. We hope that since docosanol cream shortens the healing time of cold sores, it helps you look and feel better faster. Please follow insert directions for proper use and refer to the information below. You are not alone An estimated one-in-five Americans is affected by cold sores each year. Most people who experience them get two to three cold sore outbreaks each year. Just before and during an outbreak, the cold sore infection can be easily passed on to others. It is especially important to be aware of early warning signs that a cold sore is coming, and to be sure to avoid close physical contact when you have one. Getting to the Root of the Problem A blister, or cluster of blisters around your mouth, is caused by the cold sore virus. After the cold sore has healed, the virus stays dormant in your body but can be reactivated by everyday triggers like stress, sunlight, extreme hot or cold weather, colds and flu, lack of sleep, or menstruation. The Sooner, the Better A typical cold sore outbreak can last as long as seven to ten days. The sooner you begin using docosanol cream, the more effective the medicine will be. So for best results, use docosanol cream at the very start of the cold sore - when you feel the first sign of the tingle, redness, bump or itch. Docosanol cream is different from other over-the-counter cold sore products. Only docosanol cream contains 10% docosanol, which helps to shorten the healing time of cold sores and the duration of symptoms including tingling, pain, itching and burning. Frequently Asked Questions: How is docosanol cream different from the over-the-counter cold sore remedies I have already been using? Docosanol cream is the only FDA approved non-prescription cold sore medicine that can actually shorten healing time and the duration of symptoms. The sooner you start using docosanol cream, the sooner you can begin healing your cold sore . Who can use docosanol cream? Adults and children 12 years and over can use docosanol cream. How often can I apply docosanol cream? Docosanol cream should be used five times a day until the cold sore is healed. Apply it directly to the cold sore at the first sign of a tingle, redness, bump or itch for best results. Can I apply cosmetics on top of docosanol cream? Yes, cosmetics such as lipstick may be applied over docosanol cream. However, use a separate applicator, like a cotton swab, to apply cosmetics over an unhealed cold sore to avoid spreading the infection. For best results, remove any cosmetics prior to applying docosanol cream.
