Dr. Ratcliff didn\u2019t agree with the common myth \u2018If it hurts, it must be good for you.\u2019 CloSYS \u00ae took a different approach\u2015keep it gentle, yet effective, and people will use it long enough to make a difference in their oral health. After discovering that his first patented formula was not only extremely gentle but incredibly effective, he gathered a small group of dental professionals and business leaders to start their journey toward what is today Founder of CloSYS \u00ae Oral Care. What Makes CloSYS \u00ae Products Different? Simply put, CloSYS \u00ae is the Gentlest, Oral Care. Ever. \u00ae All CloSYS \u00ae formulas are highly effective and extremely gentle so they are not harsh or irritating to sensitive mouths. And because it\u2019s so gentle, it means you can swish it in your mouth longer without having to spit it out early and risk not getting the full benefit of the rinse.
